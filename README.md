# ZLX Shred Packer®: The Sustainable Solution to Global Waste Management

Over 9 months as a design engineer part of ZLX Technology, I designed the ShredPacker. This involved choosing components and designing the full mechanism in accordance with these.

## Skills Developed
1. **Technical Proficiency with Tools**: 3D design using the with CAD tools such as SolidWorks and other engineering software.
2. **Design Engineering**: Involved in designing a complex machinery, showcasing an understanding of mechanical components and their integration for optimal performance.    
3. **Problem-Solving**: Addressed a significant global challenge - waste management in public areas, indicating a capability to work on solutions for real-world problems.
4. **Component Selection**: Selected appropriate components for the Shred Packer, which means understanding the specifications, compatibility, and efficiency of various parts.
5. **Documentation and Reporting**:
    - Produced a comprehensive "Shred Packer Documentation" detailing the product.
    - Compiled a "ZLX feasibility report" which involved critical analysis of a product iteration and provided insights into design decisions. This demonstrates analytical skills and the ability to reflect and iterate upon designs.
    - Designed a "Shred Packer Leaflet" which conveys an ability to communicate technical information in a concise and understandable manner for a wider audience.
6. **Collaboration**: Worked as part of ZLX Technology, indicating teamwork and collaboration wit its stakeholders.

## Overview
