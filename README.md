# ZLX Shred Packer®: The Sustainable Solution to Global Waste Management

Over 9 months as a design engineer part of ZLX Technology, I designed the ShredPacker. This involved choosing components and desinging the full mechanism in accordance with these.
## Overview

The ZLX Shred Packer® was designed to address the increasing challenges of waste management in public areas. Its state-of-the-art features enable the efficient processing of waste, reducing the need for frequent waste collection services.

For an in-depth analysis of the Shred Packer and its evolutionary journey, refer to the [ZLX feasibility report](https://github.com/oscell/ZLX-Shredpacker/blob/main/Documents/ZLX%20feasibility%20report.pdf).
